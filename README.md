Is there a relationship between the foreign-born population and Twitter sentiment on the topic of immigration?  
To explore this question, we matched the Twitter accounts of local NPR-affiliated news stations across the country.  
We combined this data with statistics on the size of the foreign-born population, using the US Census data (5-Year American Community Survey) in order to evaluate the relationship between local sentiment and the population characteristics.   
Tweets and their replies with foreign-born share of the population.   We may experiment with specific Twitter search terms like “immigrant” or the like.  
In order to evaluate related angles, we attached other related data on hate crimes statistics and whether or not a geography had a so-called “sanctuary city”
